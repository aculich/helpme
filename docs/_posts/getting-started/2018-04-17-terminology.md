HelpMe consists of the following components:

## Helpers
[Helpers](/helpme/helpers) are remote endpoints or resources that a user would want to request help from. A helper generally is named to correspond with the destination of interest. For example, the `github` helper submits issues for the user to Github, and the `uservoice` helper submit a ticket to uservoice on e behalf of the user. You can see a list of available helpers under [the helpers pages](/helpme/helpers).

## Recorders
[Recorders](/helpme/recorders) are functions that HelpMe provides to record an aspect of user experience to help with the request. For example, there is a recorder to capture a terminal recording, along with a whitelisted subset of the environment. For more information, see the [recorders](/helpme/recorders) pages.
