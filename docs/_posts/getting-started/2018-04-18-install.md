## Local Install
HelpMe can be installed natively (python 3 recommended) with pip:

```bash
pip install helpme
```

or you can clone and install from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme
$ cd helpme
$ python setup.py install
```

If you want to install dependencies for a particular helper, you can specify
the helper like this:

```bash
pip install helpme[uservoice]
```

When you have installed HelpMe, there will be an executable "helpme"
placed in your bin folder:

```bash
which helpme
helpme
```

## Docker
You can also use the helpme Docker image (note this has not been rigorously tested):

```
$ docker run -it vanessa/helpme
```

And of course you can build the image yourself!

```
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme
$ cd helpme
$ docker build -t vanessa/helpme .
```
